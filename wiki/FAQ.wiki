----
*How do I start?*

Okay, I give you some hints on how to get started.

The first thing you need to do is to buy a wep cracker in the game.

This can be done by clicking on the cart icon

and then in the nixxon stock shop windows press buy for wep cracker.

Next you go to your inventory, by clicking on the bag.

Then select your wepcracker, and then you need to figure out the command you need to enter.

----
*What is this controller in the game options for?*

It is possible to use the joystick from a `AVR AT90USB` system board to switch between house selection etc. 

It probably works with other devices too.

But you need to find out what the `device id` and `vendor id` of that device is.

And maybe some coding in Communication.cs is also needed.

*How does the highscore work?*

How faster you succeed to reach the end of the game and with more money left the more 

points you get.
