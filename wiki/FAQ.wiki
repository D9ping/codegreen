----
*What is this controller in the game options for?*

It is possible to use the joystick from a `AVR AT90USB` system board to switch between house selection etc. 

It probably works with other devices too.

But you need to find out what the `device id` and `vendor id` of that device is.

And maybe some coding in Communication.cs is also needed.

*This game blinks a lot, what's wrong?*

Sorry this game doesn't work very well on windows XP.

You also need a fast CPU, 1.5Ghz or more is highly recommended.
